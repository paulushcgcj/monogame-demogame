# Simple MonoGame Project

## Description

This project is a simple game developed using MonoGame, aimed at learning the basics of game development with the MonoGame framework. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of game loops, sprite rendering, input handling, and sound management in a game development context.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- MonoGame 3.8 or later
- .NET Core 3.1 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code

### Installing

1. Ensure you have the .NET Core SDK and MonoGame installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulushcgcj/monogame-demogame.git
```

3. Open the solution file in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

### Running the Application

To run the game, you first need to build it.

#### Building the project

```bash
dotnet build ./DemoGame/DemoGame.csproj
```

#### Build for Windows

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release r win-x64 p:PublishReadyToRun=false p:TieredCompilation=false --self-contained
```

Or, if using Visual Studio, hit `F5` or click on the "Run" button.

## About the Developer

I'm a seasoned developer with a journey that began in C#, but eventually, I found my passion in Java. Beyond coding, my heart lies with games of all kinds - board games, strategy games, and RPGs captivate me and inspire my creativity. While I enjoy sharing glimpses of my life and interests on Instagram as [@paulushxcx](https://instagram.com/paulushxcx), my main stage is right here on GitHub, where I explore and contribute to the world of code. Let's connect and create something amazing together.
